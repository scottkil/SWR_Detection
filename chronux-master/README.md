Open-source software for neural data analysis (v2.10)

Downloaded from www.chronux.org on November 28, 2012.

To install, clone the repository anywhere on your computer and
add it to your Matlab path. This can be done by pulling down the 
File tab in the Matlab editor. Make sure that you use "Add with
subfolders". For future use, you can save this path by clicking 
"save".

Help is available in the "documentation" directory.

First read the help in chronux.m that discusses variables that
are used repeatedly by the library and the important issue of
units.
